## About

An style agnostic components library with a flexible and extendable API, which you can use to build your own components library. If you use `Rebass` before, this is just an enhanced version of it.

## Highlights

- Final bundle is less than 2KB after gzip.
- Style agnostic, style it your way.
- Flexible API, build your own components library easily.
- Easy to pick up, every `prop` name is css prop.
- Rapid development, media query as an array or object, and no need to write CSS in most situation.
- Every component has a `css` prop, you can pass string, style object or `styled-components`'s `css` string template.
- Written by TypeScript. We ship types from start. Enjoy the auto completeion.
- Based on <a href="https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system" target="_blank">styled-system</a> and <a href="https://www.styled-components.com/" target="_blank">styled-components</a>, so you can take full power of these 2 popular libraries, but actually, you can just use it without knowning the two.
