# Responsive

In the `<BaseBox>` page, you will see lots of props are `Reponsive` type. Basically, they are just a much easier way to write your media queries. It's from `styled-system`.

The below document is just copy from `style-system`. :P

## Basic usage

```javascript
<Box
  width={[
    1,    // 100% below the smallest breakpoint
    1/2,  // 50% from the next breakpoint and up
    1/4   // 25% from the next breakpoint and up
  ]}
/>

// responsive margin
<Text m={[ 0, 1, 2 ]} />

// responsive padding
<Text p={[ 2, 3, 4 ]} />

// responsive font-size
<Text fontSize={[ 3, 4, 5 ]} />
```

> 99% props in `react-oxygen` is responsive!

## How to setup breakpoints

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

const myTheme = {
  breakpoints: ['40em', '52em', '64em', '80em'],
};

<ThemeProvider theme={myTheme}>
  <Box width={[1, 1 / 2, 1 / 4]} />
</ThemeProvider>;
```

In the end, it's just a property named `breakpoints` in your `styled-components` theme object.

## Use object style to make things more explict

You may feel use array to represent the value is somewhat implict, you want to know which breakpoint does this value associate. You can.

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

const myTheme = {
  breakpoints: {
    sm: '40em',
    md: '52em',
    lg: '64em',
    xl: '80em',
  },
};

<ThemeProvider theme={myTheme}>
  <Box
    width={{
      sm: 1,
      md: 1 / 2,
      lg: 1 / 4,
    }}
  />
</ThemeProvider>;
```

## Which one is recommend?

It depends on you, personally, I just use array everywhere. Because through a whole project, the `breakpoints` settings is the same. So use array is clean and still easy to read because of the consistency.
