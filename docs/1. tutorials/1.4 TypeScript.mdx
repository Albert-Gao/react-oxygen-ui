## Design system

If you use TypeScript, then you are lucky, we have a predefined `interface` for you to define the theme which follows the `styled-system` rule.

```typescript
import { IThemeType } from 'react-oxygen';

const myTheme: IThemeType = {
  // Now the TypeScript will give you
  // the auto completion and type checking
};
```

## Extend from React oxygen

If you use JavaScript, you just create your own component based own `react-oxygen`. But if you use `TypeScript`, you need to type checking your components which you can extend from `react-oxygen` as well. Every component exposes an interface with the component name add a letter `I`, for instance `IBox` for `<Box>`, and `IText` for `<Text>`.

```typescript
import { Box, IBox } from 'react-oxygen';

interface IMyBox extends IBox {
  // my types
}

const MyBox: React.FC<IMyBox> = ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <Box {...rest}>{children}</Box>
);
```
