# BaseBox

`BaseBox` is the foundation of every other component. All the other components is just `BaseBox` with extra `props` (like `type` for `<Input>`) or different html tag (like `<p> for <Paragraph>`). If you want to bake your own primitive components, then you might want to start from `<BaseBox>`.

The main goal of this components is to provide the all the necessary `css` propperties, so we can control them effortlessly in JS.

# Basic usage

If you want to make a component based on `span` tag, you just use the `as` prop from `styled-components`.

```javascript
const Span = ({ children, ...rest }) => (
  <BaseBox as="span" {...rest}>
    {children}
  </BaseBox>
);
```

## Props

Any prop you see here, you can use it when you use the other component. Because they are all based on `<BaseBox>`.

In short, these are just plain CSS props.
