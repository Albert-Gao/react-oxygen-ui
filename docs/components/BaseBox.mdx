# BaseBox

`BaseBox` is the foundation of every other components. All the other components is just `BaseBox` with extra `props` (like `type` for `<Input>`) and different `html tag` (like `<p> for <Paragraph>`). You probably don't need to use `BaseBox` directly, but if you want, you can bake your own primitive components based on it.

The main goal of this components is to provide the all the necessary `css` propperties, so we can control them effortlessly in JS.

# Basic usage

If you want to make a component based on `span` tag, you just use the `as` prop from `styled-components`.

<Playground>
  <BaseBox as="span">This is now rendered as a `span` tag</BaseBox>
</Playground>

## Properties

<PropsTable of={BaseBox} scales kind />
