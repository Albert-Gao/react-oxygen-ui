# BaseBox

`BaseBox` is the foundation of every other component. All the other components is just `BaseBox` with extra `props` (like `type` for `<Input>`) or different html tag (like `<p> for <Paragraph>`). If you want to bake your own primitive components which seems can't start from any of the basic components, then you might want to start from `<BaseBox>`.

The main goal of this components is to provide the all the necessary `css` propperties, so we can control them effortlessly in JS.

# Basic usage

If you want to make a component based on `span` tag, you just use the `as` prop from `styled-components`.

<Playground>
  <BaseBox as="span">This is now rendered as a `span` tag</BaseBox>
</Playground>

## Props

Any prop you see here, you can use it when you use the other component. Because they are all based on `<BaseBox>`.
