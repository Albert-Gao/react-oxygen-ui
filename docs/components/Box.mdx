# Box

`<Box>` is probably the most popular component in the library. It's a flexbox actually. Just use it when you want a `div`. But it has some handy props to make your life easier.

## Properties

All `props` from `<BaseBox>`.

### gap

> gap: Responsive

It's the gap between each children inside this `Box`. From now on, you don't need to add margin to each children. You just add this one `gap` prop in the parent `Box`.

```javascript
<Box gap="10px">
  <Box>1</Box>
  <Box>2</Box>
  <Box>3</Box>
</Box>
```

### fill

> fill: 'horinzontal' | 'vertical'

- horinzontal: `width: 100%`
- vertical: `height: 100%`

<Playground>
  <Box fill="horinzontal" bg="yellow">
    Box<span>1</span>
  </Box>
</Playground>
