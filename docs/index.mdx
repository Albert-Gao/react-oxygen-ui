# What is it

An style agnostic components library with a flexible and extendable API, which you can use to build your own components library.

# The goal

- Final bundle is less than 2KB after gzip.
- Style agnostic, style it your way.
- Flexible API, ready to extend.
- 9 components: `BaseBox`, `Box`, `Button`, `FlatButton`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Heading`, `Paragraph`, `Text` and `Image`.
- Nearly nothing to learn, every `prop` name is css prop.
- No need to write CSS at all in most situation.
- Responsive style has never been such easy. Every prop is responsive-ready, no more tedious media query.
- Every component has a `css` prop, you can pass string, style object or `styled-components`'s `css` string template.
- Written by TypeScript. We ship types from start. Enjoy the auto completeion.
