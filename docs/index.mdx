# What is it

The main goal for this project is to provide an extendable, style agnostic components library which suits most of the projects. And no need to write any CSS for a very productivity experiences.

# The goal

- Style agnostic, style it your way.
- Final bundle is less than 2KB after gzip.
- Flexible API, ready to extend.
- 9 components: `BaseBox`, `Box`, `Button`, `FlatButton`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Heading`, `Paragraph`, `Text` and `Image`.
- Nearly nothing to learn, every `prop` name is css prop.
- No need to write CSS at all in most situation.
- Responsive style has never been such easy. Every prop is responsive-ready, no more tedious media query.
- Every components contains `css` prop, you can pass string, style object or `styled-components`'s `css` string template.
- Written by TypeScript. We ship types from start. Enjoy the auto completeion.
- Based on Styled-components v4 and Styled-System v4, but most of the time, you are dealing with idomatic React props.
